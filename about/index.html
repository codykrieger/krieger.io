by night.</p><p>In 2010, as a senior in high school, I wrote and open-sourced
<a href=https://gfx.io>gfxCardStatus</a>, which, rather by accident, became overwhelmingly
popular. To this day, the gfxCardStatus website continues to see a large amount
of trafficâ€”between website visits and download traffic, on the order of 300K
unique visitors per month.</p><p>I went on to attend <a href=https://www.rit.edu>RIT</a> for software engineering. After two years and two
summer internships with Apple, I dropped out to join Apple&rsquo;s Safari team, where
I regularly learned more in days than I learned in months in academia.</p><p><a href=https://krieger.io/adieu-apple/>I left Apple</a> in 2015 to join a startup called EVA Automation, which
later acquired the storied British hi-fi brand Bowers & Wilkins. While at
Bowers, I designed and built the core of what became the operating system for
the <a href=https://www.bowerswilkins.com/formation>Formation wireless audio products</a>. In my last role before
moving on, I was the software architect for the company&rsquo;s Bluetooth headphones
division.</p><p>In mid-2019, I joined the audio team at Roku, and spent about the next year and
a half working on the company&rsquo;s fledgling <a href=https://www.roku.com/products/audio>wireless speaker
products</a> (which, incidentally, punch way above their weight, and
are worth a listen).</p><p>Presently, I&rsquo;m working on something exciting and new, and hopefully I&rsquo;ll have
more to share Soonâ„¢. âœ¨</p><h3 id=colophon>colophon</h3><p>This website is built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a>. The source code can be found
