Here's a small sampling of some of the things I've developed:

[gfxCardStatus](http://gfx.io)  
An [open source](https://github.com/codykrieger/gfxCardStatus) menu bar app for
dual-GPU MacBook Pros that tells you when apps have turned on the discrete GPU
(and therefore are using more power).

[heroku-buildpack-jekyll](https://github.com/autock/heroku-buildpack-jekyll)  
A buildpack for Heroku/Dokku/Deis for auto-generating a Jekyll site on push,
and then serving up the resulting site.

[ace-rails-ap](https://github.com/codykrieger/ace-rails-ap)  
The Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor (Ace) for the Rails 3.1+ asset pipeline.

[dotfiles](https://github.com/codykrieger/dotfiles)  
My dotfiles, including lots of great `git` aliases and other
trickery to make using a terminal really pleasant.

[dotvim](https://github.com/codykrieger/dotvim)  
My `vim`/`gvim` configuration.
