Hi, I’m Cody. I'm a naturally-curious software engineer with a passion for
sweating the details.

You may know me as the author of [gfxCardStatus][gfxCardStatus].

In addition to my day job working on Seekrit Stuff™, I do software consulting
via my California limited liability company, [novel i/o][novel]. Past employers
include Roku, Bowers & Wilkins, and Apple.
