Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cody.

I'm a software engineer by day, and a guitarist, singer, and recording engineer
by night.

In 2010, as a senior in high school, I wrote and open-sourced
[gfxCardStatus][gfxCardStatus], which, rather by accident, became overwhelmingly
popular. To this day, the gfxCardStatus website continues to see a large amount
of trafficâ€”between website visits and download traffic, on the order of 300K
unique visitors per month.

I went on to attend [RIT][rit] for software engineering. After two years and two
summer internships with Apple, I dropped out to join Apple's Safari team, where
I regularly learned more in days than I learned in months in academia.

[I left Apple][adieu] in 2015 to join a startup called EVA Automation, which
later acquired the storied British hi-fi brand Bowers & Wilkins. While at
Bowers, I designed and built the core of what became the operating system for
the [Formation wireless audio products][formation]. In my last role before
moving on, I was the software architect for the company's Bluetooth headphones
division.

In mid-2019, I joined the audio team at Roku, and spent about the next year and
a half working on the company's fledgling [wireless speaker
products][roku-speakers] (which, incidentally, punch way above their weight, and
are worth a listen).

Presently, I'm working on something exciting and new, and hopefully I'll have
more to share Soonâ„¢. âœ¨
