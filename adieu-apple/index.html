Automation</a>, where Iâ€™ll be working on exciting as-yet-unannounced things.
(Leaving Apple doesnâ€™t mean I get to eschew secrecy, apparently. ðŸ˜‰)</p><p>Words canâ€™t easily describe how difficult it was to leave. After two summer
internships and a two-and-a-half-year full-time stint split between the Mac and
iOS Safari teams, Apple (and Safari) felt like home.</p><p>I canâ€™t deny, though, that I felt restrained in that role. Iâ€™ve always had
dreams of making games (among other things), and I couldnâ€™t do that while bound
by a policy barring me from developing apps on my own time. Leaving Apple gives
me that freedom once again.</p><p>Of the many things Iâ€™ll miss, my brilliant teammates take the cake. I learned
more from them, every single day, than I ever could have hoped to learn in
school.</p><p>Maybe Iâ€™ll regret leaving, but I donâ€™t think so.</p><p>I feel like this journey has only just begun.</p></article><aside class=deemphasized>Did this post resonate with you?
