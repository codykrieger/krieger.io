Today was my last day at Apple.

I'm thrilled to announce that, effective March 9th, I'll be joining [EVA
Automation][eva], where I'll be working on exciting as-yet-unannounced things.
(Leaving Apple doesn't mean I get to eschew secrecy, apparently. :wink:)

Words can't easily describe how difficult it was to leave. After two summer
internships and a two-and-a-half-year full-time stint split between the Mac and
iOS Safari teams, Apple (and Safari) felt like home.

I can't deny, though, that I felt restrained in that role. I've always had
dreams of making games (among other things), and I couldn't do that while bound
by a policy barring me from developing apps on my own time. Leaving Apple gives
me that freedom once again.

Of the many things I'll miss, my brilliant teammates take the cake. I learned
more from them, every single day, than I ever could have hoped to learn in
school.

Maybe I'll regret leaving, but I don't think so.

I feel like this journey has only just begun.
